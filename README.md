## Brief description of the case study:
### The case study assigned was to create a parcel management system. The system has 30 slots for storage, but can only hold the items for a maximum of 2 days before being returned to sender. The item is stored based on house number,and each storage can only store a maximum of 5 parcels. With this in mind, our solution is a 2D list of houses. There will be 30 houses numbered from 1 to 30, and each house has a corresponding slot that can store up to 5 parcels. We will be using Lists to manipulate the data, A Parcel class to create a unique parcel object, DateTime class for date functions and using json files to store the data.
